# Switch Case Statements

According[^1] to Aaron Digulla on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/680656/what-is-the-difference-between-if-else-and-switch)

- Switch case is often more compact than nesting
- ommiting the break in the switch case allows to fallthrough to further cases 
- Switch only accepts certain types and constants, which makes it faster but useful in less cases
- Best practice formatting is rather confusing.
- While slower if-else arguments allow all data-types and more complex expressions so while switch-cases are very useful in highly specific situations generally it is best to use if-else
