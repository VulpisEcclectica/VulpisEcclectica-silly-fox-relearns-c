# A little refresher for a little fox

Yes I recognise that intro was probably rather goofy but... oh well! this is mostly personal, Hopefully it may help someone but it is written with myself as the primary audience (Perks of having awful memory) so be-ware :warning: more potentially '_cringe_' language
Anyhow, with that out of the way what we can get into the meat of it:

# What is this actually about?

For whatever reason I've decided that the best post burnout project is to learn Rust; first though I need a refresher on memory management so how am I planning to do this? In the most over the top fox-girlway of course! The basic plan is like this 

> Refresh C knowledge (CS50 + LearnC.org) => dive into memory management with x86_64-ASM (various srcs) => finally the crab language (docs.rust.org, the rust book, gentle intro, rustonomicon etc)

All this while writing a couple thesis and finishing HS, am I probably a little stupid for doing it this way? (Yea probably) but am I going to do it anyway (Yes!)

I'll go through the sources above and do the projects, putting down lil writups along the way (again very memory/self focused so won't be super professional). The CS50 ones are in private bot managd repos by harvards design (ikik I do not like them very much but learning is learning ig) but ill copy the stuff I write back over here and do little write ups on it as I go, I am only redoing the C part of that course so I wont be of much help with Python/Javascript sorry.

# lessons (Learn-C.org) 

- L1: slightly modified hello world => [code](./code/l1) | [notes](./notes/l1)
- L2: very basic review of variables and data-types => [code](./code/l2) | [notes](./notes/l2)
- L3: basic array review, no need to write notes or code on this one
- L4: Review of multi dimensional arrays and how an array of _n_ dimensions is analagous to a tensor of order _n_ => no code but decent [notes](./notes/l4)
